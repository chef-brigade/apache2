# Additional server flags:
#
# Put here any server flags ("Defines") that you want to hand over to 
# httpd at start time, or other command line flags.
#
# Background: Any directives within an <IfDefine flag>...</IfDefine>
#             section are only processed if the flag is defined.
#             This allows to write configuration which is active only in a
#             special cases, like during server maintenance, or for testing
#             something temporarily.
#
# Notably, to enable ssl support, 'SSL' needs to be added here.
# To enable the server-status, 'STATUS' needs to be added here.
#
# It does not matter if you write flag1, -D flag1 or -Dflag1.
# Multiple flags can be given as "-D flag1 -D flag2" or simply "flag1 flag2".
#
# Specifying such flags here is equivalent to giving them on the commandline.
# (e.g. via rcapache2 start -DReverseProxy)
#
# Example:
#      "SSL STATUS AWSTATS SVN_VIEWCVS no_subversion_today"

# Which config file do you want to use?
# (if not set, /etc/apache2/httpd.conf is used.)
# It is unusual to need to use this setting.
#
# Note about ulimits:
#   if you want to set ulimits, e.g. to increase the max number of open file handle, 
#   or to allow core files, you can do so by editing /etc/sysconfig/apache2 and
#   simply write the ulimit commands into that file.
#   Example:
#     ulimit -n 16384
#     ulimit -H -n 16384
#     ulimit -c unlimited
#   See the output of "help ulimit" in the bash, or "man 1 ulimit".
